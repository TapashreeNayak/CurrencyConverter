# CurrencyConverter

Programming Exercise â€“ FX Calculator 
 
Your task is to create a console-based currency converter application.   
 
Requirements 
 
The application allows a user to convert an amount in a specific currency to the equivalent amount in another currency. 
 
Your calculator should allow a user to enter an amount in any of the known currencies, and provide the equivalent amount in another currency. 
 
Your calculator should parse console input like "<ccy1> <amount1> in <ccy2>", and provide a suitable response. 
 
For example:  
 
%> AUD 100.00 in USD 
 
AUD 100.00 = USD 83.71 
 
%> AUD 100.00 in AUD 
 
AUD 100.00 = AUD 100.00 
 
%> AUD 100.00 in DKK 
 
AUD 100.00 = DKK 505.76 
 
%> JPY 100 in USD 
 
JPY 100 = USD 0.83 
 
If the rate cannot be calculated, the program should alert the user: 
 
%> KRW 1000.00 in FJD 
 
Unable to find rate for KRW/FJD 
 
When displaying amounts back to the user, they should be formatted with the precision given below: 
 
AUD=2 decimal places 
CAD=2 decimal places CNY=2 decimal places CZK=2 decimal places DKK=2 decimal places EUR=2 decimal places GBP=2 decimal places JPY=0 decimal places NOK=2 decimal places NZD=2 decimal places USD=2 decimal places 
 
The list of currency pairs and rates that you are given is: 
 
AUDUSD=0.8371 CADUSD=0.8711 USDCNY=6.1715 EURUSD=1.2315 GBPUSD=1.5683 NZDUSD=0.7750 USDJPY=119.95 EURCZK=27.6028 EURDKK=7.4405 EURNOK=8.6651 
 
In order to perform the required calculations, the program needs the amount of decimal places, currency pairs and rates above,  and also a table to show how to derive non-quoted/crossed rates. 
 
Currency pairs are specified as <<BASE>> <<TERMS>> (sometimes written as BASE/TERMS - eg. AUD/USD). 
 
Rates are always specified as "1 BASE = x TERMS", where x is the rate. 
 
For example "AUDUSD=0.8371" means that 1 Australian Dollar is equivalent to 0.8371 United States Dollars. 
 
The rates specified above are directly quoted, but they can also be used to create non quoted rates. 
 
For example, in the simplest case, the AUDUSD rate can be used to derive USDAUD by simply inverting the rate. "AUDUSD=0.8371" (1 AUD = 0.8371 USD) is the same as saying "USDAUD=1.1946" (1 USD = 1.1946 AUD). 
 
A slightly more complicated example involves deriving a particular rate by "crossing" via another currency. 

For example: you are asked for the AUDJPY rate - but there is no direct feed for this rate.  Instead, you can "cross via USD" and use the AUDUSD and USDJPY rates.  This works by first converting AUD to USD, and then USD to JPY. 
 
For example         1 AUD = 0.8371 USD   0.8371 USD = 100.41 JPY       --------------------------   1 AUD = 100.41 JPY 
 
In order to help with the conversion, the following "cross-via" matrix may help.  "Base" currencies are down the left, "terms" currencies across the top. 
 
/ AUD CAD CNY CZK DKK EUR GBP JPY NOK NZD USD AUD 1:1 USD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD D CAD USD 1:1 USD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD D CNY USD USD 1:1 USD USD USD USD USD USD USD D CZK USD USD USD 1:1 EUR Inv USD USD EUR USD EUR DKK USD USD USD EUR 1:1 Inv USD USD EUR USD EUR EUR USD USD USD D D 1:1 USD USD D USD D GBP USD USD USD USD USD USD 1:1 USD USD USD D JPY USD USD USD USD USD USD USD 1:1 USD USD Inv NOK USD USD USD EUR EUR Inv USD USD 1:1 USD EUR NZD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD USD 1:1 D USD Inv Inv Inv EUR EUR Inv Inv D EUR Inv 1:1 
 
 
D = direct feed - eg. the currency pair can be looked up directly. Inv = inverted - eg. the currency pair can be looked up if base and terms are flipped (and rate = 1/rate) 1:1 = unity - the rate is always 1. CCY = in order to calculate this rate, you need to cross via this currency. 
 
You can choose to represent the above table however you choose.  You may, for example, be able to use the inherent symmetry of the table to derive a more compact representation. 
 
As an example of using the table above, consider that you need to calculate an AUD/JPY rate: - first, look up AUD/JPY in the above table. - the resulting entry shows that you need to cross via USD - next look up AUD/USD - the rate for this is fed direct - now look up USD/JPY - also fed direct - fetch the rates for AUD/USD and USD/JPY and generate the cross rate from there.
